## [1.0.0] – 2026-06-28

First production release built entirely from public source.

  instead of an empty `{}`. (#7)
- Registration: clears the grid-operator name validation error on ID selection. (#5)

### Changed
- Restored source files from source maps so the admin frontend builds from source. (#1)
- CI: push to the registry's development tier with an auto-rollout bridge
  (dispatch-deploy). (#3, #4)
- Added AGPL-3.0 license; README with service overview and tech stack. (#2, #6)
